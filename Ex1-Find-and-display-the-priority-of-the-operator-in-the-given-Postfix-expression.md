# EX 1 Youâ€™re creating a health monitoring device which stores several sensor readings in an array. To determine the minimum value (e.g., lowest heartbeat), implement a recursive method.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a JAVA program To determine the minimum value (e.g., lowest heartbeat), implement a recursive method.

## Algorithm
